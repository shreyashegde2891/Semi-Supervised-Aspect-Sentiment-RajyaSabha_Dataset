The Drugs (Prices Control) Order, 1995 .(DPCO` 95) was promulgated by the Govt. India on 6th January; 1995 in exercise of the powers conferred by Section 3 of the Essential Commodities Act 1955. As per the criteria specified in para 22.7.2 of the `Modifications in Drug Policy,1986, 76 bulk drugs (subsequently reduced to 74) are included in the First Schedule of DPCO` 95.

However, for few Chemicals which are under Restricted List the cases are decided by Export Facilitation Committee which comprises of representatives of various Departments. The prices of scheduled formulations are fixed by National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA). The NPPA consists of officials of NPPA, Ministry of Finance and Drugs Controller General (India). (c) & (d): There are 74 bulk drugs specified in the First Schedule of DPCO, 1995. As per provisions contained in the said Order, NPPA fixes/ revises the prices of formulations containing any of the 74 scheduled bulk drugs. The pricey are fixed/revised as per paragraph 7 of DPCO, 1995. In the case of imported scheduled formulations, the landed cost forms the basis of fixing its price along with such margin to cover selling and distribution expenses including interest and importer`s profit which shall not exceed fifty per cent of the landed cost. For the purpose of this provision, `landed cost` means the cost of import of formulation inclusive of customs duty and clearing charges. There were some reports in the newspapers in the recent past regarding promotional expenses being made by the Pharma Companies. The reports suggest that some unethical marketing practices are being followed by certain pharma companies. Keeping in view the seriousness of the allegations made in the medical reports, this Department felt the need to take up the matter in the interest of the consumers/patients as such promotional expenses being extended to doctors had direct implications on the pricing of drugs and its affordability. After discussing the issues with the Pharma Associations/Industry, this Department has been able to persuade most of the associations to have Code of ethics. Organization of Pharmaceutical Producers of India (OPPI) and Indian Drug Manufacturers` Association (IDMA) have informed that they along with Confederation of Indian Pharmaceutical (CIPI), Federation Pharmaceutical Enterpreneurs (FOPE), Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA) and SME Pharma Industries Confederation (SPIC) have worked out the `Uniform Code of Pharmaceutical Marketing Practices` (UCMP). However, in a news article appearing in The Economic Times, Delhi dated 11.12.2009, it has been reported that a Senior Vice-chairman, SPIC has stated that they do not agree with the draft proposal. This Department has written to IDMA and OPPI to clarify the above statement. No one can sell any scheduled drugs/formulations at a price higher than that fixed by NPPA/Govt. Prices are fixed as per paragraph 7 of DPCO, 1995. The prices of non-scheduled imported finished formulations are not fixed by NPPA. NPPA, however, monitors the price movement of non-scheduled formulations. The monthly reports of ORG IMS and the information furnished by individual manufacturers are utilized for the purpose of monitoring prices of non-scheduled formulations. Whenever a price increase beyond 10% per annum is noticed, the manufacturer is asked to bring down the price voluntarily failing which, subject to prescribed conditions, action is initiated under paragraph 10(b) of the DPCO, 1995 for fixing the price of the formulation in public interest."

In the case of rice, due to poor monsoon, kharif production is likely to be lower than the demand. Similarly in the case of sugar, production has fallen short of demand in 2008-09. In order to check hoarding and blackmarketing, the Government of India has taken the following steps:- (i) Powers have been vested with State Governments for taking action under the provisions of Essential Commodities Act, 1955 and Prevention of Blackmarketing and Maintenance of Supplies of Essential Commodities Act, 1980. (ii) To enable the State Governments/UT Administrations to take effective action for undertaking de-hoarding operations under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955, it was decided to enable State Governments to impose stockholding limits by keeping in abeyance some provisions of the Central Order dated 15.02.2002 in respect of pulses, edible oils, edible oilseeds, rice and paddy for the period upto 30.09.2010.

The increase in prices of the rice and wheat can be attributed partly due to the increase in MSP. Domestic prices of pulses rose mainly on account of the supply- demand mismatch and hardening of international prices. The increase in price of salt was due to un seasonal and intermittent rains during the September/December 2008 in the salt producing areas of Gujarat and Rajasthan during manufacturing season. Weather, apart from seasonal factors, may have contributed to increase in prices of vegetables and fruits. Potato prices increased as during 2008-09 potato production was estimated to be less in the states of Bihar, West Bengal and M.P because of late blight disease and less water availability in M.P. Onion prices increased primarily on account of the floods in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka and the heavy rain in Maharashtra, which affected the kharif crop of onion and its supply to markets across the country. (d) : The Government has taken steps to protect poor sections of society through Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) and Antodaya Anna Yojna (AAY). Under the TPDS, wheat, rice, coarse grains and kerosene are allocated to State Governments/UTs for distribution through the Fair Price Shops. The Central Issue Price for rice and wheat has not been revised since 2002. For wheat it remains at Rs 4.15 per kg for BPL and Rs 2 per kg for AAY. For rice, it is Rs 5.65 per kg for BPL and Rs 3 per kg for AAY. Pulses are distributed to the State Governments under the PDS @ Rs.10 per kg subsidy scheme. In view of the rise in prices of essential commodities witnessed during the recent past, Government has allocated imported edible oils to State/UT Governments. States are free to distribute the oil through whatever outlets they decide on."

Thomas) (a) : Facts show that futures trading in essential commodities has not been responsible for the price rise in recent period. There is no future trading in Urad and Tur since January 2007 when it was suspended. But the prices of these commodities are showing sharp increase during 2008-09 and 2009-10. The year-on-year price increase (in terms of Wholesale Price Index) at the end of financial year 2008-09 (29.3.2009) was 14.7% for Urad and 17.1% for Tur. During the year 2009-10 (as on 28.11.09) Y-o-Y increase was 59.46% and 72.25% for Urad and Tur respectively. As against this there is futures trading in Gram. Year on Year change of Prices of Gram was negative at -6.8% in 2008-09 and 4.32% during 2009-10 (as on 28.11.09) respectively.

The forward trading in a commodity is a mechanism for price discovery and price risk management and not a mechanism to check price rise. The futures market gives price signals for future periods of time based on the most likely supply and demand situation at those points of time. The market is tightly regulated. There are various effective tools like margins, price band, open interests limit etc. which the Regulator (Forward Market Commission) employs to regulate futures trading. (b) : The total value of trade during period three months of April to June 2009 was Rs.15, 64,114.96.

(b): The details of companies who have violated the ECB guidelines and penalties imposed by RBI thereto are given below. 1) Reliance Infrastructure Ltd (RIL) (formerly Reliance Energy Ltd) End-use violations have been observed by RBI in the ECBs raised by RIL pertaining to two ECBs for USD 360 million and USD 150 million. The company brought the proceeds raised through the said ECBs to India and kept these invested in debt mutual funds, pending utilization for the declared end-use in gross violation of the extant ECB guidelines. On an application filed by the company for compounding the end-use violations relating to the ECB of USD 360 million, a compounding order was passed in terms of Foreign Exchange (Compounding Proceedings) Rules, 2000 and a penalty of Rs. 124.68 crore was levied. Since RIL did not pay the penalty in accordance with the Rules and the Provisions of FEMA, the violations were referred to the Directorate of Enforcement (DoE) in November 2008 for adjudication. 2) Reliance Natural Resources Ltd (RNRL) RNRL issued FCCB of USD 300 million in October 2006 for the purpose of ‚<U+0080><U+0098>project‚<U+0080><U+0099> under the automatic route. USD 275 million (Rs 1127 crore) were brought to India in May 2007 and were parked in debt mutual funds pending utilization. Subsequently, in Aug 2008, an amount of Rs.1160 crore (USD 275 million) was invested in a wholly owned subsidiary in Singapore. Since the alleged transactions have cross-border angle and since the Reserve Bank does not have the privileges of investigation, the issue has been referred to the DoE for undertaking investigation in the matter. 3) Reliance Communications Ltd (RCom) A study of the audited report for the year March 2007 revealed that the unutilized money of Rs. 5,142 crore raised through issue of various FCCBs by the company has been deposited interest free with a wholly owned subsidiary which in turn has held the same in bank deposits. After ascertaining the facts, RCom was advised in August 2009 to apply for compounding under FEMA 1999. The company in their response has stated that the proceeds of the FCCBs were utilized for permitted end-use (telecommunication capital expenditure) taking into account the business exigencies and denied any contravention of the Regulation / Direction under FEMA. The reply is being examined for taking further action. (c): Two companies belonging to the Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group (ADAG) namely Rosa Power Supply Company Ltd (RPSCL) and Vidarbha Industries Power Ltd (VIPL) have approached the Reserve Bank of India under the approval route for raising ECB of USD 550 million each towards Import & local sourcing of capital goods for implementing power projects.

Twelfth Finance Commission (TFC) recommended the DCRF over the period 2005-10. The Scheme has two components - (i) consolidation of central loans (from Ministry of Finance) contracted till 31.3.2004 and outstanding as on 31.3.2005, and (ii) provision of interest relief and grant of debt waiver to States based on their fiscal performance. Consolidation of central loans has given interest relief to States. Debt waiver is granted to States based on their fiscal performance, for which an assessment is made annually. Benefits under DCRF helped States by easing debt and interest pressures, and also incentivised States to follow the path of fiscal correction. This has facilitated the states to focus investment on development.

RRBs Act, 1976 and do not require licence for the purpose. RRBs, however, require licence from Reserve Bank of India(RBI), for opening of branch/es under section 23 of Banking Regulation Act. As regards cooperative banks, there are 31 State Cooperative Banks (StCBs) and 371 District Central Cooperative Banks (DCCBs), at the end October, 2009, in the country, out of which, 17 StCBs and 296 DCCBs are unlicensed. These unlicensed banks are allowed to function as banks under Section 22 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (AACS) till they are granted licence or their applications for licence are rejected in writing by the Reserve Bank of India. Following measures have been taken to run RRBs as systematic institutions: (i) The Reserve Bank has constituted Empowered Committees for RRBs in its Regional Offices with members drawn from NABARD, sponsor banks, convenors of SLBCs and State Government concerned to ensure that the RRBs adhere to good governance and comply with prudential regulations. The Committees would also focus on operational issues and provide clarifications on regulatory issues. (ii) In order to reposition RRBs as effective instruments of credit delivery Government of India, in consultation with NABARD, the State Governments and the sponsor banks initiated State-level sponsor bank-wise amalgamation of RRBs. Consequent upon the amalgamation effected since September 12, 2005, the total number of RRBs declined from 196 to 84 as on date. The structural consolidation of RRBs has resulted in the formation of new RRBs which are financially stronger and bigger in size in terms of business volume and outreach, enabling them to take advantages of the economies of scale and reduce operational costs. (iii) In terms of the Budget Announcement for the year 2007-08, 27 RRBs were identified for recapitalisation for an amount of Rs. 1795.97 crore. All these 27 RRBs having negative net-worth have been fully recapitalised with an aggregate amount of Rs.1796 crore. (iv) RBI had set up two Working Groups for (i) preparing a road map for RRBs to adopt appropriate technology and migrate to Core Banking Solutions and (ii) examining provision of financial assistance to RRBs for defraying cost in implementing information and communication technology (ICT) based solutions for financial inclusion. The implementation of Groups` recommendations is in progress. Further, the Government of India had set up a Task Force under the chairmanship of Prof. A. Vaidyanathan in August 2004 to formulate a practical and implementable plan of action to rejuvenate short term rural co-operative credit structure comprising State Co-operative Bank at the apex (State) level, Central Co-operative Banks at the intermediate (district) level and Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS) at the ground (village) level. Based on the recommendations of the Task Force and in consultation with the State Governments, the Government of India approved a Package in 2006 for revival of the short-term rural co¬¨operative credit structure. The total financial assistance under the Revival Package has been estimated at Rs 13,596 crore to be shared by the Central Government, State Governments and Co-operative Credit Structure.

The G ` 20 Finance Ministers have been deliberating upon the financing options for climate change. (d) Yes sir (e) The following stand has been taken by India: 1) The primacy of UNFCCC has to be upheld. 2) Substantial funds are required for climate change. 3) Climate finance should be anchored in the well-established principles of equity and `common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities` articulated in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the roadmap set out in the Bali Action Plan. 4) Providing finance for addressing the needs of developing countries to address climate change is a commitment of the Annex I Parties under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. 5) Any discussion on climate finance has to recognise the distinction between Annex I and non-Annex I countries and the principles, objectives and provisions of the Convention. 6) Private finance would need to be leveraged to augment public resources. However, we must remain cautious about placing our trust fully on the market mechanism. One of India`s primary concerns is that the funds available for mitigation and adaptation should be reliable, predictable and sustainable and that carbon trading may therefore not be the `silver bullet` for addressing climate change. 7) Public funds from developed countries have to be the main source of Climate Change Finance and resources have to be essentially grant based. 8) Right institutions within the UNFCCC to help deliver on the promise of funding the mitigation and adaptation should be created. Finally, the G-20 FMs agreed to commit to work towards an ambitious outcome in Copenhagen within the objective, provisions and principles of the UNFCCC. The G20 Finance Ministers also agreed to take forward further work on Climate Change Finance, to define financing options and institutional arrangements."

(b) Yes sir. (c) Statement is laid on the table on the house. (d) The statements made were generally welcomed by all the G-20 countries. (e) This is contained in the statement laid at (c) above. Statement on the points that were discussed during the summit and to what extent these measures helped India to improve economy: In the Pittsburgh Summit the following issues were discussed: 1. Framework for strong, sustainable and balanced growth 2. Progress and priorities on strengthening the International Financial Regulatory Systems 3. Reforms in the International Financial Institutions 4. Food, fuel and Finance for the poor of the world 5. Energy Efficiency and climate change 6. Putting Quality jobs at the heart of the recovery 7 An open Global Economy 8. Future role of the G-20 The G-20 countries agreed for a framework for strong, sustainable and balanced growth and a mutual assessment process to assess whether policies are consistent with the shared objectives. In addition, the countries agreed to continue the stimulus till recovery is assured. There was a renewal of the commitment to carry on the strengthening of the International Financial Regulatory System and not return to the scenario of banking as usual. To this end the G-20 countries agreed to act together to raise capital standards, implement strong international compensation standards aimed at ending practices that leads to excessive risk taking, improve over the counter derivative markets, and to create powerful tools to hold large global firms to account for the risks that they take. The Leaders agreed for an at least 5 percent shift in quotas to dynamic emerging market and developing countries in the IMF by January 2011. The Leaders also agreed for a similar shift of at least 3 percent in voting power in the World Bank for developing and transition countries by the 2010 Spring Meetings. The Leaders also agreed to take new steps to increase access of the world`s poor to food, fuel and finance and to rationalise and phase out over the medium term inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption while providing targeted support (for fuel) for the poorest. In addition, the Leaders agreed to promote energy market transparency and market stability as part of a broad effort to avoid excessive volatility. There was agreement that G-20 countries will fight protectionism and aim for a successful conclusion of the Doha Round as also reach agreement in Copenhagen through the UNFCCC negotiations. One of the other major outcomes of the Pittsburgh Leaders` Summit has been to make the G-20 the premier multilateral forum for global economic cooperation. Major benefits for India: Indian Economy`s return to trend growth also depends on the turnaround in the economy of the developed countries. Commitment to continue the stimulus till recovery is assured (and thereby avoid the risk of double dip) coupled with the pledge to shun protectionism will help the Indian economy through the trade channel. The framework for strong sustainable and balanced growth while covering all G-20 countries will also bring the actions and policies of systemically important economies under multilateral mutual assessment and will help all as actions/policies that encourage global imbalances (including development imbalances) will be subject matter for debate and corrections. The steps for strengthening the International Financial Regulatory Systems are aimed at avoiding another financial crisis and this will help in the long run by avoiding the volatility of capital flows that follows a financial crisis. In addition, the international policy development will help in making the Indian Financial Regulatory Systems further strong. The shift in quotas in the IMF and of the voice and representation in the World Bank in favour of the dynamic emerging markets and the developing countries will also benefit India and correct to some extent the legitimacy and governance deficit in these international financial institutions.

M.VEERAPPA MOILY) (a) to (d): Information on the time spent by under-trial prisoners, while their cases are under the process of adjudication in the courts, as against the period of their respective probable sentences is not maintained centrally.

A short list of the recommendations made by the Law Commission is given in the Annexure. For the exhaustive list o recommendations made in the above mentioned Reports of the Law Commission the official website of the Law Commission of India http://lawcommissionofinqiia.nic.ir may please be referred. (b) As per the latest available information, 53,221 cases were pending in the Supreme Court as on 30.09.09. As per the figures received from the High Courts, 40,18,914 cases were. pending High Courts 3,2,71,20,108 cases were pending in the subordinate Courts as on 30.06.09. (c) Government has taken several steps to facilitate disposal of cases in the courts including pending cases, which include: (i) Increasing the strength of judges in the High Courts and subordinate Courts. (ii) `Fast Track Courts` extended upto 31.10.2010. (iii) Introduction of some legislative measures for improvement in judicial procedure and for expediting disposal of civil arid criminal cases in courts. The Civil Procedure Code and Criminal Procedure Code have been amended and the concepts of ‚<U+0080><U+0098>Plea-Bargaining‚<U+0080><U+0099> has been introduced. (iv) Other measures like grouping of cases involving common questions of law, constitution of specialised benches, setting up of special courts and organizing Lok Adalats at regular intervals have also been taken. (v) Steps have also been taken for modernisation of the judicial infrastructure through computerization of courts. Government is implementing a scheme for computerization of District and Subordinate Courts and for upgradation of the Information and Communication Technology infrastructure of the Supreme Court and the High Courts. (vi) Government has enacted the Gram Nayalayas Act, 2008 (Act 4 of 20,09) which provides, for establishment of over 5000 Gram Nyayalayas and will justice at the doorstep of the rural people. (vii) Government. has been encouraging the Alternative Dispute Resolution methods to facilitate dispute resolution outside the courts and to reduce pendency of cases in the country. Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 has been amended to provide for settlement of disputes through arbitration, conciliation, judicial settlement through Lok Adalat or through mediation. A short list of the recommendations made by Law Commission (1) The service condition of judges and judicial Officers ought to be improved drastically if `the judicial machinery is to function efficiently. The Commission also suggested that the age of retirement of judges should be raised from 62 years to 65 years. (2) Proper housing facilities, transport facilities etc should be provided to the judges. The overall infrastructure of the courts also needed to be improved. (3) The work of maintaining and controlling the Court Diary should be done by the presiding officers and not by the readers. While fixing cases for a particular date, the presiding officer should ensure that the number of cases fixed on that date is such that can be easily disposed of on that day, while keeping a margin for collapse of few cases because of unforeseen circumstances. (4) Arguments ought to be heard just after the close of evidence. Unduly lengthy arguments and tendency to cite needlessly large number of authorities should be discouraged. Judgments of the trial courts should deal with questions of fact appraising the evidence, referring to relevant statutory provisions and citing only those authorities which have direct bearing on the case. (5) Time lag between pronouncement of judgment and preparation of decree should not be too long, and should be done within 15 days time span, as laid down by Order 20, Rule 6A of the CP.C. (6) Setting up of Conciliation Boards an experimental basis, in selected areas in disputes giving rise to claims for recovery of money not exceeding Rs. 5000. Adoption of conciliation would go a long way in relieving the Courts of heavy load of civil cases. (7) Creation of an All India Judicial Service, with the same rank and pay scales as the IAS. (8) In its analysis and study, the Commission found that in India, there are 10.5 judges per million people. While contrasting this with other countries, it could be seen that these countries had substantially greater number of judges per million population. Australia has 46 judges per million, Canada has 75.2 judges per million, England has 50 judges per million and U.S.A. has 107 judges per million. India is demographically and politically much larger than these nations and yet with only 7,675 judges, it is far behind these countries. The Commission recommended that by the Year 2000, India should command at least the ratio U.S.A. commanded in 1981 i.e. 107 judges per million people. (9) Radical restructuring of the grass root justice system which would provide a regulatory mechanism to the inflow of work to the High Court and the Supreme Court and reduce the number of second appeals. (10) The Chief Justice should enlist the services of retired judges for setting up benches composed of two judges to do civil, criminal and miscellaneous work in the morning. The Chief Justice, depending upon the pendency of old matters, should draw a line of the base year and then direct that all matters pending up to the base year and admitted before the base year should be exclusively assigned to the retired judges. The retired judges will use the same building during the pre-lunch session and the sitting judges can use it after lunch. This will give them ample time to write judgments regularly. This suggestion has a double advantage as their will be optimum utilisation of fixed capital as well as speedy disposal of cases because the judges have rich expertise and experience in delivering justice. The retired judges should be paid the salary drawn by sitting judges without deducting pension or gratuity."
